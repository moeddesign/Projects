// How It Works:
// The code starts displaying the text "We Love Programming!" one character at a time, starting with the first character.
// It keeps adding one more character in each iteration until the whole text is displayed.
// When the entire text is displayed, it resets and starts over from the first character.
// The typing speed is controlled by the value of the input field (speedEl). When the user changes the input value, the speed adjusts dynamically.
// Example HTML (to run this code):
// You’ll need an HTML structure like this for the JavaScript to work:

 // HTML EXAMPLE  
 
 //       ↓
    
// <div id="text"></div>
// <input type="number" id="speed" value="1" min="1" max="10">
// #text: The text will appear here.
// #speed: The user can change the value in this input field to adjust the typing speed.
// Let me know if you want help integrating this with an HTML page or customizing it further!
